    """Calculates the coefficients of the natural cubic spline approximation to the batch of controls given.

    Arguments:
        t: One dimensional tensor of times. Must be monotonically increasing.
        X: tensor of values, of shape (..., L, C), where ... is some number of batch dimensions, L is some length
            that must be the same as the length of t, and C is some number of channels. This is interpreted as a
            (batch of) paths taking values in a C-dimensional real vector space, with L observations. Missing values
            are supported, and should be represented as NaNs.

    In particular, the support for missing values allows for batching together elements that are observed at
    different times; just set them to have missing values at each other's observation times.

    Warning:
        Calling this function can be pretty slow. Make sure to cache the result, and don't reinstantiate it on every
        forward pass, if at all possible.

    Returns:
        Four tensors, which should in turn be passed to `controldiffeq.NaturalCubicSpline`.

        Why do we do it like this? Because typically you want to use PyTorch tensors at various interfaces, for example
        when loading a batch from a DataLoader. If we wrapped all of this up into just the
        `controldiffeq.NaturalCubicSpline` class then that sort of thing wouldn't be possible.

        As such the suggested use is to:
        (a) Load your data.
        (b) Preprocess it with this function.
        (c) Save the result.
        (d) Treat the result as your dataset as far as PyTorch's `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and
            `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` classes are concerned.
        (e) Call NaturalCubicSpline as the first part of your model.
