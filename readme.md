LibCity is a unified, comprehensive, and extensible library, which provides researchers with a credible experimental tool and a convenient development framework in the traffic prediction field. Our library is implemented based on PyTorch and includes all the necessary steps or components related to traffic prediction into a systematic pipeline, allowing researchers to conduct comprehensive experiments. Our library will contribute to the standardization and reproducibility in the field of traffic prediction.

LibCity currently supports the following tasks:

* Traffic State Prediction
  * Traffic Flow Prediction
  * Traffic Speed Prediction
  * On-Demand Service Prediction
  * Origin-destination Matrix Prediction
  * Traffic Accidents Prediction
* Trajectory Next-Location Prediction
* Estimated Time of Arrival
* Map Matching
* Road Network Representation Learning

## Features

* **Unified**: LibCity builds a systematic pipeline to implement, use and evaluate traffic prediction models in a unified platform. We design basic spatial-temporal data storage, unified model instantiation interfaces, and standardized evaluation procedure.

* **Comprehensive**: 65 models covering 9 traffic prediction tasks have been reproduced to form a comprehensive model warehouse. Meanwhile, LibCity collects 35 commonly used datasets of different sources and implements a series of commonly used evaluation metrics and strategies for performance evaluation. 

* **Extensible**: LibCity enables a modular design of different components, allowing users to flexibly insert customized components into the library. Therefore, new researchers can easily develop new models with the support of LibCity.

## Overall Framework

![](https://bigscity-libcity-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/framework.png)

* **Configuration Module**: Responsible for managing all the parameters involved in the framework.
* **Data Module**: Responsible for loading datasets and data preprocessing operations.
* **Model Module**: Responsible for initializing the reproduced baseline model or custom model.
* **Evaluation Module**: Responsible for evaluating model prediction results through multiple indicators.
* **Execution Module**: Responsible for model training and prediction.

## Installation

LibCity can only be installed from source code.

Please execute the following command to get the source code.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LibCity/Bigscity-LibCity
cd Bigscity-LibCity
```

More details about environment configuration is represented in [Docs](https://bigscity-libcity-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/install.html).

## Quick-Start

Before run models in LibCity, please make sure you download at least one dataset and put it in directory `./raw_data/`. The dataset link is [BaiduDisk with code 1231](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qEfcXBO-QwZfiT0G3IYMpQ) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g5v2Gq1tkOq8XO0HDCZ9nOTtRpB6-gPe?usp=sharing). All dataset used in LibCity needs to be processed into the [atomic files](https://bigscity-libcity-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/data/atomic_files.html) format.

The script `run_model.py` is used for training and evaluating a single model in LibCity. When run the `run_model.py`, you must specify the following three parameters, namely **task**, **dataset** and **model**.  

For example:

```sh
python run_model.py --task traffic_state_pred --model GRU --dataset METR_LA
```

This script will run the GRU model on the METR_LA dataset for traffic state prediction task under the default configuration.  **We have released the correspondence between datasets, models, and tasks at [here](https://bigscity-libcity-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/data/dataset_for_task.html).** More details is represented in [Docs](https://bigscity-libcity-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/quick_start.html).

## TensorBoard Visualization

During the model training process, LibCity will record the loss of each epoch, and support tensorboard visualization.

After running the model once, you can use the following command to visualize:

```shell
tensorboard --logdir 'libcity/cache'
```

```
