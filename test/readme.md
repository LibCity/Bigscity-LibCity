# Test Scripts

HA, SVR, VAR, ARIMA are not deep learning models and are therefore implemented using a single script. 

The default parameter configuration of the scripts is shown in the 'config' of the respective files and should be modified as needed before running. 

The run method is as follows.

(1) Activate the environment:

`conda activate <your environment>`

(2) Run the script **in the Bigscity-LibCity/ directory**: 

`cd Bigscity-LibCity/`

`python test/test_HA.py`
